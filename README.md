# Morph

A programming language you can shape to your needs.
(Probably not feasable at all but yeah...)

## Why am I doing this

This was just a random idea and I was bored.

## Concept

This should be a programming language which you can customize on the fly.

Somewhere in your program you can overwrite standart keywords and switch between different styles,
you should also be able to decide how structs and types work.

I'm gonna put the full specification into [this file](SPEC.md).
